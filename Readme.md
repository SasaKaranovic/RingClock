# My New RingClock

I wanted to build myself a cool clock that would look nice, be different and make absolutely no sound. And so I did. 

Check out [this post to see how I did it](https://sasakaranovic.com/projects/ringclock/)

Few things that would help you read time from this clock:

- RED led is hour hand
- GEEN led is minute hand
- YELLOW leds are hour markers (12, 1, 2, and etc)
- Elapsed minutes will be "filled" with rainbow colors that rotate over time

Now with that, you can see that clock is showing 4:55
